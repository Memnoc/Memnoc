# 👋 Hi, I'm Memnoc

Senior Lead of Business Systems (CX systems), Software Engineer, Systems Architect. I wore many hats during my long career in the tech industry. I have been a support agent, a technical writer, a self-service specialist, a programmer, a systems architect and a people leader. 

Lately, I have been craving more academic pursuits. I am passionate about systems programming, GUIs, TUIs, language theory, computer science theory. In my spare time, I love contributing to open source software, building compilers and interpreters, programming web apps.

## Tech Stack

### Sytems, TUIs, compilers

## What I Do

Currently, I lead a team of systems engineers specialised in Post Sales & Integration systems. My role is to architect and implement solutions that bridge the gap between complex systems and user needs. As a programmer, I have found my niche developing internal tools for my team. Being at my team's service has opened the door to an ever interesting series of real-life issues I can express and solve using code.

### Current Focus

- Compilers and Interpreters: working on implementing compilers and interpreters, mainly in C
- Building foundational components from first principles: mainly in my day-to-day job
- Exploring programming language theory and implementation: toy languages, small domain languages
- Crafting efficient CLI tools for developer productivity: if a problem can be solved with a TUI, I'll probably go for it
