## What I Do

Currently leading Post Sales & Integration systems, where I architect and implement solutions that bridge the gap between complex systems and user needs. As a programmer, I have found my niche developing internal tools for my team. This activity has opened the door to an ever interesting series of issues I can solve using software.

### Current Focus

- Compilers and Interpreters: working on implementing small domain languages
- Building foundational components from first principles
- Exploring programming language theory and implementation
- Crafting efficient CLI tools for developer productivity

## Core Interests

- Low-level programming and systems design
- Programming language theory and implementation
- Compiler construction and optimization
- Building robust, scalable integration systems
