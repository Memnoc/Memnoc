### Current Focus

- Compilers and Interpreters: working on implementing small domain languages
- Building foundational components from first principles
- Exploring programming language theory and implementation
- Crafting efficient CLI tools for developer productivity

## Core Interests

- Low-level programming and systems design
- Programming language theory and implementation
- Compiler construction and optimization
- Building robust, scalable integration systems
